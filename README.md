# Waker-Agent-for-Multiplication
Waker Agent Multiplication  This repository contains a Java implementation of a simple agent-based system using the JADE. The system has a single agent, WakerAgent, that utilizes a WakerBehaviour to perform a multiplication on two integers after a specified delay. The agent prompts the user for input, computes the product, &amp; then terminates itself.

# Waker-&-Ticker-Agents-for-Multiplication-&-Addition
Waker Agent Multiplication  This repository contains a Java implementation of a simple agent-based system using the JADE. The system has a single agent, WakerAgent, that utilizes a WakerBehaviour to perform a multiplication on two integers after a specified delay. The agent prompts the user for input, computes the product, &amp; then terminates itself.

SECOND AGENT
The secpnd project implements a simple TickerAgent using the JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework) to create a simple agent-based application. The agent runs a periodic task every 10 milliseconds to prompt the user for two numbers via console input and calculates their sum. The project demonstrates the use of JADE's TickerBehaviour to execute repetitive tasks in an agent-based environment.
